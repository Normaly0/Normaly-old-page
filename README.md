# :fountain_pen: 3D Commissions Page

The heart and soul of my page, dedicated towards the 3D art and commissions that I do on the side.
You can check out the live page [here](https://normaly0.github.io/)!

## :mag: About

Using SCSS and the newly learned knowledge that I just gained back then this was one of the first bigger pages that I've ever created.
However, considering that quite a few months have passed since then I'm now planning to rework the entire page structure, as well as functionality.

I'll most likely opt for building the new page with a react framework, possibly also utilizing redux.

## :clipboard: To Do

Ideas:
- add separation between retextures, 3D modeling etc.
- add a gallery for each of those 
- add the ability to scroll through pictures
- possibly add a segment that would display the current commission queue
- change up the displayed work
- include example pictures of 3D modeling and scene creation

I should also rework the socials tab and add my newly made [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/normaly) page.
